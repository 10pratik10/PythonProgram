#petroluses FILE
<br>
In the first file about petroluses, we have calculated the number of days left until the fuel will zero. This information is calculated by putting the total daily distance we travel and divide it by mileage <br>
<br>
**__PROJECT CONCEPT__** <br>
<br>
1) Predict the average daily distance travelled<br>
2) Ananlyse the Mileage drop and rise chart<br>
3) Suggest the shorter routes to save more fuel and time<br>
4) Let driver decides how much days they wants to keep fuel and guide driver how much distance they needs to travel per day and suggest better routes<br>
5) Connect google map module<br>
6) Create fuel expense data (daily/weekly/monthly) <br>
7) Connect gps module to analyze data automatically<br>
8) Connect weather module for analyze weahter data<br>
9) Establise the weather plan and recommend the best timeline to drive car<br>
10) Optimize the cars performance by showing required speed and uses by analysize the traffic - weather conditions<br>
11) Show the final data.<br>
