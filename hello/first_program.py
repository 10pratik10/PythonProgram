print("hello world")

#just type print and rest is the history!

#Python is simple programming language and can be begin without any programming knowlegdge. But I still recommend you to learn from C++ or Java, that will help you to laid the strong foundation in your mind. You don't have to learn everything in C++ or Java, but make sure to clear the basic concept of this language like OPPs, Boolean, Matrix etc.

#If you don't want to be full time programmer, just like explore the hobby or create basic games or build an decent app or you are just lazy. Then Python is best start.

#In IDE where you write code, the "hello world" sentence is called as Literal, it begans after variable or function like (print, string, int etc)

#About that hastag, it called "Comment", system will not recognize comment as the program.

#Compilor (where you type the program and run), don't identify the comment at all.

#Comment's best purpose is for writing the notes, like (I want to make some change here, I will do it tommorow, This code need update etc.), etc.
